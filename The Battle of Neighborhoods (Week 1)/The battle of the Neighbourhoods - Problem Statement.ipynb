Therefore, it attracts a lot of people from diverse and multilingual backgrounds.Which makes it neccessary for some insight to be given to these immigrants so as to help them choose the right place to live based on their personal preferences."

Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
